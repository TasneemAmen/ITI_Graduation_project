# KPI CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================
# Each KPI has:
# - target_kpi: The main KPI column name to analyze
# - bad_direction: "low" or "high" - direction indicating degradation
# - default_threshold: Default degradation threshold percentage
# - category: KPI category (Traffic, Integrity, Accessibility, etc.)
# - output_prefix: Prefix for output file names
# - min_baseline_value: FALLBACK value when baseline is zero/NaN and no
#   historical data available (same weekday from 5 weeks ago).
#   NOTE: This is NO LONGER an exclusion threshold! All cells are now
#   included in analysis. This value is only used as a last resort when:
#   1. baseline_avg_kpi = 0 or NaN, AND
#   2. No historical data from 5 weeks ago available
#   Recommended: Set to a "typical healthy" value for the KPI.
# - related_rules: List of related counters for root cause detection
